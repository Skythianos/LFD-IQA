# LFD-IQA: A Human Visual System Inspired No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Method Based on Local Feature Descriptors
**Paper title**: A Human Visual System Inspired No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Method Based on Local Feature Descriptors<br/><br/>
**Abstract**: Objective quality assessment of natural images plays a key role in many fields related to imaging and sensor technology.
Thus, this paper intends to introduce an innovative quality-aware feature extraction method for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA).
To be more specific, a various sequence of HVS inspired filters were applied to the color channels of an input image to enhance those statistical
regularities in the image to which the human visual system is sensitive. From the obtained feature maps, the statistics of a wide range of local
feature descriptors were extracted to compile quality-aware features since they treat images from the human visual systemâ€™s point of view.
To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, it was compared to 16 state-of-the-art NR-IQA techniques on five large benchmark databases,
i.e., CLIVE, KonIQ-10k, SPAQ, TID2013, and KADID-10k. It was demonstrated that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art in
terms of three different performance indices.<br/><br/>
